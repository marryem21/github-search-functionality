Title: github with search functionality
Objective: the main objective of this project is being able to extract, display and access Github users' repositories and profile informations from an interface that mimics the real Github interface  

Technologies used: -React.js
                   -Typescript
                   -Github APIs
                   -Axios
How to run the project:
*in your terminal type: npm install
*in your terminal go to the directory where the project resides (cd/[the project's path])
*in your terminal type : npm install axios
*in your terminal type : npm start

Future improvements: - Expand the project to behold the "Overview", "Projects" and "packages" feature.
                     - Make the search features more dynamic by displaying a drop down showing possible searches.
                     - Improve the instructions user interface showing in the repos section

Personal thoughts on the exercise: 
*It was an opportunity for me to work with APIs more and mimic an existing interface since I usually design my own interfaces for my frojects.
*I would rather showing another example of the desired result with another user or give instruction about whether we are fetching all the users' data or just one.
*The use of typescript was not clear(all the project in typescript or using just some typescript)
Thank you ;) <3

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
